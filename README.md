# Saloni-BugReports
Introduction:
Welcome to the Bug Reports Repository! Here, We will use this place to practice finding and reporting buggs, and working together on GitHub.
Purpose:
This repository helps us to learn about finding and reporting bugs, and using Github's tools for managing them.By doing this, we learn why it's important to report bugs well in software development. Throughout this assignment, we'll create bug reports, make templates for reporting bugs, and work together to solve problems.
